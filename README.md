# To-Do App (Symfony-MariaDB)

## Overview

This project is a task management application developed with **Symfony** and **MariaDB** as the backend technologies. It provides basic functionality to manage tasks effectively.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Sort tasks based on their status (**pending** or **completed**).
- Each task displays its current status below the task name.

## Technologies Used

- **Symfony**: Backend framework for application logic.
- **MariaDB**: Database management system.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application.
- **Docker Compose**: Managing and orchestrating multiple containers.

## Architecture

The application consists of two Docker containers:

1. **Symfony App**: Hosts the backend application.
2. **MySQL Container**: Hosts the database.

Both containers communicate within the same Docker network named `to-do`.

## Prerequisites

- **Option 1**: Run locally:

  - PHP 8.1 or higher installed.
  - Composer installed.
  - MariaDB server installed and running.

- **Option 2**: Run with Docker:
  - Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
